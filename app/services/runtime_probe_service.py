app/services/runtime_probe_service.py
--------------------------------------
Small helper utilities for local/manual runtime verification of the Doubt Solver
invoke path.  These functions are NOT called by the main application workflow —
they are used only by manual smoke scripts and developer tooling.

Exports
-------
build_doubt_solver_smoke_payload() -> dict
    Return a representative valid payload for a local HTTP smoke call.

validate_doubt_solver_response_shape(response: dict) -> tuple[bool, list[str]]
    Check that a raw response dict contains all required Doubt Solver fields.
    Returns (is_valid, list_of_missing_or_bad_fields).

Manual smoke workflow (no auto-invocation here):
    1. Start local runtime:   make dev
    2. Curl:                  make smoke-doubt-solver
    3. Validate response:     inspect returned JSON or call
                              validate_doubt_solver_response_shape(json.loads(...))
