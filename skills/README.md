# skills/ — AI Coding Agent Guidance

This directory contains **repo-local development knowledge** for AI coding agents
(Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and others).

> The files here are **never deployed**.  They exist only to give coding agents
> accurate, project-specific context so they make consistent, safe decisions.

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Always read `AGENTS.md` first** — it is the single authoritative instruction file.
2. Then read the relevant file(s) below before writing or reviewing code.
3. When you create or change a feature, update the matching `features/<name>.md`.
